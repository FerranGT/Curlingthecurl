#CURLING THE CURL PROJECT

This project is created as a Full-Stack (MEAN-Stack) Project in the BootCamp SkylabCoders in 2016 by Ferran Gonzalez.

##The Goal

This project is created for hair saloons.
The project has two parts, a front-end part where the user can interact in four tabs, home tab (description of the side),productos tab where you can see all the products available in the hair salon and servicios tab, all the services that hair salon offers, and the last tab you can book a service in the hair salon.
The second part of the side is the tab administrador, where the owner of the salon can upload all this products and services to the DB, can check all of them filtering by type or name, updating the content or deleting the item.
